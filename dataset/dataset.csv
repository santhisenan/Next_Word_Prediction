"Neural network apparatus and methods for implementing reinforcement learning. In one implementation, the neural network is a spiking neural network, and the apparatus and methods may be used for example to enable an adaptive signal processing system to effect focused exploration by associative adaptation, including providing a negative reward signal to the network, which may increase excitability of the neurons in combination with decrease in excitability of active neurons.

"A pseudo-analog electronic or optoelectronic neuron stores synaptic weights as analog quantities, preferably as charges upon capacitors or upon the gates of floating gate transistors. Multiplication of a stored synaptic weight times a binary pulse-width-modulated synapse input signal periodically produces electrical charge of a first polarity on a first synapse capacitor. Meanwhile a fixed charge of opposite polarity is periodically produced at the same frequency upon another, second, synapse capacitor. The charges on both synapse capacitors at many synapses are periodically accumulated, and integrated, at a single neuron soma in the form of pulse-amplitude-modulated charge-encoded signals. This accumulation, and integration, transpires continuously progressively by a switched-capacitor technique, and during the entire duration of the input signal to each synapse. The net final result, expressed in signed electrical charge, is converted back to a PWM binary signal for transmission to further neurons. A fully capacitive synapse typically occupies a compact area of 45.lambda..times.42.lambda., consumes less than 2 .mu.W dynamic power (at 1 MHz) and offers more than 90% of the full voltage scale for linear weight adaptation.

"A two-level hierarchical approach for process fault diagnosis is an operating system employs a function-oriented approach at a first level and a component characteristic-oriented approach at a second level, where the decision-making procedure is structured in order of decreasing intelligence with increasing precision. At the first level, the diagnostic method is general and has knowledge of the overall process including a wide variety of plant transients and the functional behavior of the process components. An expert system classifies malfunctions by function to narrow the diagnostic focus to a particular set of possible faulty components that could be responsible for the detected functional misbehavior of the operating system. At the second level, the diagnostic method limits its scope to component malfunctions, using more detailed knowledge of component characteristics. Trained artificial neural networks are used to further narrow the diagnosis and to uniquely identify the faulty component by classifying the abnormal condition data as a failure of one of the hypothesized components through component characteristics. Once an anomaly is detected, the hierarchical structure is used to successively narrow the diagnostic focus from a function misbehavior, i.e., a function oriented approach, until the fault can be determined, i.e., a component characteristic-oriented approach.",Combined expert system/neural networks method for process fault diagnosis

""" The present invention relates to the interrelationships between nature (as mediated by evolution and genetic algorithms) and nurture (as mediated by gradient-descent supervised learning) in a population of neural networks for pattern recognition. The Baldwin effect is demonstrated that learning can change the rate of evolution of the population's genome - a """"pseudo-Lamarkian"""" process, in which information learned is ultimately encoded in the genome by a purely Darwinian process. Selectivity is shown for this effect: too much learning or too little learning in each generation leads to slow evolution of the genome, whereas an intermediate amount leads to most rapid evolution. For a given number of learning trials throughout a population, the most rapid evolution occurs if different individuals each receive a different number of learning trials, rather than the same number. Because all biological networks possess structure due to evolution, it is important that such interactions between learning and evolution be understood. Hybrid systems can take advantage both of gradient descents (learning) and large jumps (genetic algorithms) in very complicated energy landscapes and hence may play an increasingly important role in the design of artificial neural systems.

"An automated speech recognition system converts a speech signal into a compact, coded representation that correlates to a speech phoneme set. A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition. To train the neural network, digitized voice data containing known phonemes that the user wants the neural network to ultimately recognize are processed by the integrated user interface. The digitized speech is segmented into phonemes with each segment being labelled with a corresponding phoneme code. Based on a user selected transformation method and transformation parameters, each segment is transformed into a series of multiple dimension vectors representative of the speech characteristics of that segment. These vectors are iteratively presented to a neural network to train/adapt that neural network to consistently distinguish and recognize these vectors and assign an appropriate phoneme code to each vector. Simultaneous display of the digitized speech, segments, vector sets, and a representation of the trained neural network assist the user in visually confirming the acceptability of the phoneme training set. A user may also selectively audibly confirm the acceptability of the digitization scheme, the segments, and the transform vectors so that satisfactory training data are presented to the neural network. If the user finds a particular step or parameter produces an unacceptable result, the user may modify one or more of the parameters and verify whether the modification effected an improvement in performance.

"Described herein is a method and system for training nonlinear adaptive filters (or neural networks) which have embedded memory. Such memory can arise in a multi-layer finite impulse response (FIR) architecture, or an infinite impulse response (IIR) architecture. We focus on filter architectures with separate linear dynamic components and static nonlinear components. Such filters can be structured so as to restrict their degrees of computational freedom based on a priori knowledge about the dynamic operation to be emulated. The method is detailed for an FIR architecture which consists of linear FIR filters together with nonlinear generalized single layer subnets. For the IIR case, we extend the methodology to a general nonlinear architecture which uses feedback. For these dynamic architectures, we describe how one can apply optimization techniques which make updates closer to the Newton direction than those of a steepest descent method, such as backpropagation. We detail a novel adaptive modified Gauss-Newton optimization technique, which uses an adaptive learning rate to determine both the magnitude and direction of update steps. For a wide range of adaptive filtering applications, the new training algorithm converges faster and to a smaller value of cost than both steepest-descent methods such as backpropagation-through-time, and standard quasi-Newton methods.

"To avoid the problem of category assignment in artificial neural networks (ANNs) based upon a mapping of the input space (like ROI and KNN algorithms), the present method uses &#8220;probabilities&#8221;. Now patterns memorized as prototypes do not represent categories any longer but the &#8220;probabilities&#8221; to belong to categories. Thus, after having memorized the most representative patterns in a first step of the learning phase, the second step consists of an evaluation of these probabilities. To that end, several counters are associated with each prototype and are used to evaluate the response frequency and accuracy for each neuron of the ANN. These counters are dynamically incremented during this second step using distances evaluation (between the input vectors and the prototypes) and error criteria (for example the differences between the desired responses and the response given by the ANN). At the end of the learning phase, a function of the contents of these counters allows an evaluation of these probabilities for each neuron to belong to predetermined categories.

"A system for determining the location of a mobile station based upon measurable mobile data values such as those provided by mobile-assisted handoff (MAHO) procedures. The mobile stations make signal strength measurements of nearby base stations and return that information to the serving base station. A timing advance necessary to synchronize the mobile may also be determined. The signal strength measurements and the timing advance data then provide information to map to an estimated vehicle location. Since the mobiles are assumed to measure signal strength discretely, there may be several consecutive positions along a road which return identical mobile data. The road is thus segmented into constant segements which are consecutively indexed, and an association is established between the associated mobile data vector and the index. The process for location of a mobile consists of first finding the road for the mobile unit, then finding the position along the road. The mobile vector is sequentially input into a look up table or neural networks (one for each road in the sector) until an output coordinate pair actually lies near the corresponding road.

"A method and apparatus are disclosed that modify [ies] and generalize [s] the use in artificial neural networks of the error backpropagation algorithm. Each neuron unit first divides a plurality of weighted inputs into more than one group, then sums up weighted inputs in each group to provide each group's intermediate outputs, and finally processes the intermediate outputs to produce an output of the neuron unit. Since the method uses, when modifying each weight, a partial differential coefficient generated by partially-differentiating the output of the neuron unit by each weighted input, the weight can be properly modified even if the output of a neuron unit as a function of intermediate outputs has a plurality of variables corresponding to the number of groups. Since the conventional method uses only one differential coefficient, that is, the differential coefficient of the output of a neuron unit differentiated by the sum of all weighted inputs in a neuron unit, for all weights in a neuron unit, it may be said that the method according to the present invention generalizes the conventional method. The present invention is especially useful for pulse density neural networks which express data as an ON-bit density of a bit string.",Neural network and method for training the neural network

"An adaptive hierarchical neural network based system with online adaptation capabilities has been developed to automatically adjust the display window width and center for MR images. Our windowing system possesses the online training capabilities that make the adaptation of the optimal display parameters to personal preference as well as different viewing conditions possible. The online adaptation capabilities are primarily due to the use of the hierarchical neural networks and the development of a new width/center mapping system. The large training image set is hierarchically organized for efficient user interaction and effective re-mapping of the width/center settings in the training data set. The width/center values are modified in the training data through a width/center mapping function, which is estimated from the new width/center values of some representative images adjusted by the user. The width/center mapping process consists of a global spline mapping for the entire training images as well as a first-order polynomial sequence mapping for the image sequences selected in the user's new adjustment procedure.",Neural network based auto-windowing system for MR images

"Fully automated methods and systems for processing complex data sets to identify abnormalities are described. In one embodiment, the system includes wavelet processing, recursive processing to determine prominent features, and then utilizing feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) to classify feature vectors generated in the wavelet and recursive processing. With respect to wavelet processing, multiresolution (five-level) and multidirection (two-dimensional) wavelet analysis with quadratic spline wavelets is performed to transform each image. The wavelets are a first-order derivative of a smoothing function and enhance the edges of image objects. Because two-dimensional wavelet transforms quantize an image in terms of space and spatial frequency and can be ordered linearly, the data is processed recursively to determine prominent features. A neural network approach derived from sequential recursive auto-associative memory is then used to parse the wavelet coefficients and hierarchy data. Since the wavelet coefficients are continuous, linear output instead of sigmoidal output is used. This variation is therefore referred to as linear output sequential recursive auto-associative memory, or LOSRAAM. The objective of training the LOSRAAM network is to have the output exactly match the input. Context units arising from serial evaluation of the wavelet coefficient triplets may be collected as vectors. These vectors are subjected to cluster analysis. This analysis yields a number of identifiable and discrete states. From these states, feature vectors are created. Each element in the feature vector represents the number of times the corresponding state from the above cluster analysis is found. Then, feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained to classify feature vectors.",Neural network based methods and systems for analyzing complex data
"A new image reconstruction technique for imaging two- and three-phase flows using electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) has been developed based on multi-criteria optimization using an analog neural network, hereafter referred to as Neural Network Multi-criteria Optimization Image Reconstruction (NN-MOIRT)). The reconstruction technique is a combination between multi-criteria optimization image reconstruction technique for linear tomography, and the so-called linear back projection (LBP) technique commonly used for capacitance tomography. The multi-criteria optimization image reconstruction problem is solved using Hopfield model dynamic neural-network computing.

Input to the neural net is provided from a set of bandpass filters which separate the input acoustical patterns into frequency ranges. The neural net itself is organized into two parts, the first for performing the real-time decomposition of the input patterns into their primitives of energy, space (frequency) and time relations, and the second for decoding the resulting set of primitives into known phonemes and diphones. During operation, the outputs of the individual bandpass filters are rectified and fed to sets of neurons in an opponent center-surround organization of synaptic connections (""""on center"""" and """"off center""""). These units compute maxima and minima of energy at different frequencies. The next sets of neurons compute the temporal boundaries (""""on"""" and """"off""""), while the following sets of neurons compute the movement of the energy maxima (formants) up or down the frequency axis. Then, in order to recognize speech sounds at the phoneme or diphone level, the set of primitives belonging to the phoneme is decoded such that only one neuron or a non-overlapping group of neurons fire when a particular sound pattern is present at the input. The output from these neurons is then fed to an Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) decoder and computer for displaying in real-time a phonetic representation of the speech input.

"The present invention discloses low noise, optically coupled optoelectronic and all-optical artificial neuron devices that can be configured in an array to simulate the function of biological neural networks, and methods for making the artificial neurons. In a first optoelectronic embodiment, the device employs the regenerative pulsation property of astable multivibrators as optical pulse generators. A photosensitive detector, disposed in a circuit to control the state of an astable or bistable multivibrator, converts the intensity of the input light into a train of light pulses having a frequency that is a function of the intensity of the input signal. In an all-optical embodiment of an artificial neuron, an input signal is first integrated and the integrated signal transmitted to an optical pulse generator comprised of a nonlinear material disposed within the cavity of a Fabry-Perot etalon.

When a weak light signal reaches the neuron's input port, there is no light pulse emitted from the output port. By contrast, a strong signal, or a group of weak signals, triggers a short-lived light pulse. The output pulse frequency is a function of the summed input signal power.",Optical pulse-coupled artificial neurons

"In the computer interpretation of seismic data, the critical first step is to identify the general class of an unknown event.

This pre-processed input is fed into the SONNs. These neural networks are able to group events that look similar. The ART SONN has an advantage in classifying the event because the types of cluster groups do not need to be pre-defined.

A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition.

"An unsupervised back propagation method for training neural networks. For a set of inputs, target outputs are assigned l's and O's randomly or arbitrarily for a small number of outputs. The learning process is initiated and the convergence of outputs towards targets is monitored. At intervals, the learning is paused, and the values for those targets for the outputs which are converging at a less than average rate, are changed (e.g., 0.fwdarw.1, or 1.fwdarw.0), and the learning is then resumed with the new targets. The process is continuously iterated and the outputs converge on a stable classification, thereby providing unsupervised back propagation. In a further embodiment, samples classified with the trained network may serve as the training sets for additional subdivisions to grow additional layers of a hierarchical classification tree which converges to indivisible branch tips. After training is completed, such a tree may be used to classify new unlabelled samples with high efficiency. In yet another embodiment, the unsupervised back propagation method of the present invention may be adapted to classify fuzzy sets.",Unsupervised neural network classification with back propagation
"Bottleneck link speed, or the transmission speed of the slowest link within a path between two nodes, is determining by transmitting a sequence of ICMP ECHO data packets from the source node to the target node at a selected interval and measuring the return data packet intervals. Rather than using statistical analysis methods, the return data packet interval measurements are input into an adaptive resonance theory neural network trained with the expected interval for every known, existing network transmission speed. The neural network will then classify the return data packet interval measurements, indicating the bottleneck link speed. Since most of the computation&#8212;that required to train the neural network&#8212;may be performed before the data packet interval measurements are made rather than after, the bottleneck link speed may be determined from the return data packet interval measurements significantly faster and using less computational resources than with statistical analysis techniques. Moreover, fewer measurements are required to determine bottleneck link speed to the same degree of accuracy.",Use of adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural networks to compute bottleneck link speed in heterogeneous networking environments
